We also illustrate the disciplinary ebbs and flows of work group research over the past quarter century and how many different scholars from diverse institutions are currently contributing to the literature. We highlight the progress that has been made both in terms of scholarly insights and practical advances."

Social networks not only enabled work team researchers to theorize about interdependencies and the dynamic interplay of team components (i.e., individuals, dyads, and whole teams) but also provided a methodological tool kit with which to operationalize and test hypotheses about such interdependencies.  We outline an agenda for future research that introduces three promising areas to guide researchers to move the field forward."
